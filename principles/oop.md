# Pillars of Object-oriented Programming

## Abstraction

Abstraction is a model of real world object or phenomenon, limited to a specific context, which represents all details relevant to the context with high accuracy and omits all the rest.

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the ability of an object to hide parts of its state and behaviors from other objects, exposing only a limited interface to the rest of the program.

## Inheritance

Inheritance is the ability to build new classes on top of existing ones.

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism is the ability of a program to detect the real class of an object and call its implementation even when its real type is unknown in the current context.
