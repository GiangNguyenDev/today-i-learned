## Step 0: Understand Yourself

First and foremost, build something that you’re passionate about. Interest is the best way to keep yourself motivated, so ask yourself what do you care about or what do you like to do.

## Step 1: Pick an Idea

Now that you’ve hopefully figured yourself out, it’s time to pick an idea to build. Start simple. It doesn’t matter if the app already exists (in fact it may help you if similar projects already exist).

Once you have a direction, write down in one sentence the purpose, and, if applicable, the most important target users for this app.

For example: A pet adoption app for people who pick up stray animals.

## Step 2: Define the Core Functionalities

Think about what your app should be able to do and list them out. Focus on things that will allow the app to perform whatever it’s supposed to do—everything else can be left for a different project.

## Step 3: Sketch Your App

Nothing is quicker than a pen & paper. By now you should have a pretty solid idea of what your app should do, so sketch out the wireframe of your app’s UI. Write down notes and flesh out how the app should work. You’re still in the brainstorming stage, so change stuff around until you’re somewhat satisfied with it.

All in all, this is not the final look but rather just a step to help you get a firmer grasp of your app.

## Step 4: Plan Your App’s UI Flow

Now it’s time to figure out, how a user should use your app from start to end. Chart out every step they have to take, and every scenario they might encounter. Try to consider every use-case. Include all the actions your user can take in the flowchart. As your app should be fairly simple, your diagram should not be too massive.

## Step 5: Designing the Database

After you planned out every possible scenario, take a look at it to determine what sort of data you would need to keep. You can draw an ERM (Entity-Relationship Model) diagram to map out the data relationship. In addition, if you have any future features planned, this is the time to plan them into your database.

If the app you’re planning is going to interact with a server or with an API, then it’s likely a good idea to draw a sequence diagram for you to get a better idea of how the processes should operate.

## Step 6: UX Wireframes

You know what you need—now you have a much better idea of what your app should look like. Many wire framing and mock-up tools exist online to help you plan your UX/UI flow (e.g. Microsoft Visio, Diagrams.net).

## Step 7: Researching Solutions

Take a look at all diagrams you’ve drawn as well as the functionality list you’ve made in step 2. What are some things you have absolutely no idea how to build? Let's go research solutions on internet, start brainstorming, discuss with friends, colleagues or in a forum.

## Step 8: Building the App

Checklist: You should focus on building the app function by function. To keep track of your progress, you can write down a to-do list of functions and use it as a checklist.

Write Tests First: It’s a good idea to write a test for your function first before you actually begin to code the feature. Bugs are inevitable, but testing will greatly reduce your mistakes and your chances of releasing buggy code to production.

Use Git to manage your codes.
