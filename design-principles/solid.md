# S - Single Responsibility

Every class should have only one responsibility

# O - Open-Closed

Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification

# L - Liskov Substitution

Derived or child classes must be substitutable for their base or parent classes

# I - Interface Segregation

Clients should not be forced to depend upon interfaces that they do not use

# D - Dependency Inversion

High-level modules/classes should not depend on low-level modules/classes. Both should depend upon abstractions.

Abstractions should not depend upon details. Details should depend upon abstractions.
